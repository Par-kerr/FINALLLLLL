                We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they
                are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are
                Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments
                are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,
                --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the
                Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying
                its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them
                shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will
                dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and
                transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more
                disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing
                the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations,
                pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute
                Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to
                provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of
                these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their
                former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a
                history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the
                establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be
                submitted to a candid world.
